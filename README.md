# Intro to Java Workshop - [Brewing Java](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R472pOGGygU1i91IaFonYTf0hpeNNSbU8H15fsRtMu8/edit#slide=id.gf895c1fca3_0_10)

Welcome to "Brewing Java", a workshop crafted by Anushka Ganesh for Pearl Hacks 2024, UNC-Chapel Hill's annual hackathon focusing on the empowerment of women in the field of computer science. This GitHub repository serves as a one-stop hub for all the materials utilized in the workshop, designed specifically for beginners eager to dive into the world of Java programming.

# ðŸŒŸ **About the Workshop:**<br>
This workshop is tailored for individuals new to programming or those looking to strengthen their foundational skills in Java. I start the workshop off with a theoretical outline of Java, explaining its importance and applications as a programming language. This will be followed by an introductory hands-on programming session, starting with basic code that lays the groundwork for Java programming. As the workshop progresses, attendees will have the oppourtunity to apply their newly acquired skills to develop a simple yet fully functional mini calculator. Towards the end of the workshop, I will introduce some mathematical functions and relational operators frequently used in Java. Participants are encouraged to apply these techniques in their Pearl Hacks projects and to practice further using the code examples provided for these topics. To support further exploration, additional complex codes have been included in the material, offering a pathway for those interested in advancing their Java proficiency to a higher level.

Feel free to reach out to me with any questions, at any point of time!
